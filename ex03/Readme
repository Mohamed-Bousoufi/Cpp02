The area of a triangle in determinant form
is the formula used to find the area of the triangle
when the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle are given.
Suppose we have to find the area of triangle 
ABC with vertices A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2), and C(x3, y3),
then its area is calculated using the formula,

Area = (1/2) [x1 (y2 – y3) + x2 (y3 – y1) + x3 (y1 – y2)]
